# 🧠 Mental Health Score Predictor

A full-stack machine learning web app that predicts a student's **mental health score (0–10)** from their daily habits — sleep, study time, screen time, physical activity, and stress level — using a model trained on real student social-media and lifestyle data.

Built as an end-to-end ML project: data exploration → model training → FastAPI backend → responsive vanilla JS frontend → live deployment.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This tool is for educational and self-reflection purposes only. It is **not** a clinical or diagnostic instrument. If you're struggling, please talk to a qualified mental health professional or someone you trust.

## ✨ Live Demo

🔗 **[Try it here](https://mental-health-project-1-yvhu.onrender.com)**

> Hosted on Render's free tier — the backend may take 30–60s to spin up on first request if it's been idle.

## 📸 Overview

The app asks for a few quick details about a student's day-to-day habits and returns a predicted wellness score, visualized on a gauge, along with general, non-clinical wellness suggestions.

| Section | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Profile** | Age, gender, country |
| **Academic & Digital Habits** | Academic level, most-used platform, purpose of use, daily screen time, phone unlocks |
| **Lifestyle & Stress** | Study hours, physical activity, sleep, perceived stress level |
| **Result** | Predicted score (0–10) with a visual gauge and contextual read |

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

**Backend**
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) — REST API serving the model
- [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) — request/response schema validation
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) — trained prediction pipeline (`ColumnTransformer` + regressor)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) / [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/) — data handling and model serialization
- [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) — ASGI server

**Frontend**
- Vanilla **HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript** — no frameworks
- Communicates with the backend via `fetch()` against the `/predict` REST endpoint

**Model Development**
- `mental_health.ipynb` — data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and model training on the dataset below

**Deployment**
- [Render](https://render.com/) — backend (and static frontend) hosting

## 📊 Dataset

`Student Social Media And Mental Health Impact.csv`

Contains per-student records of demographics, academic level, social media usage patterns, and lifestyle habits (sleep, study, physical activity, stress) used to train a regression model that predicts an overall mental health score.

## 🚀 Running Locally

### 1. Clone the repo
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/tomerdivyanshu456-ship-it/Mental_Health-Score-Predictor.git
cd Mental_Health-Score-Predictor
\`\`\`

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended)
\`\`\`bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
\`\`\`

### 3. Install dependencies
\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

### 4. Run the backend
\`\`\`bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
\`\`\`
The API will be live at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, with docs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### 5. Run the frontend
Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve it locally:
\`\`\`bash
python -m http.server 5500
\`\`\`
Then visit `http://localhost:5500/index.html`.

> **Note:** `script.js` has an `API_BASE`/`API_BASE_URL` constant at the top — point it at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` for local development, or your deployed backend URL for production.

---

## ☁️ Deployment (Render)

**Build command**
\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

**Start command**
\`\`\`bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
\`\`\`

> ⚠️ Render runs on Linux, which is **case-sensitive** for filenames — unlike Windows. Make sure the filename referenced in `main.py` (`joblib.load(...)`) exactly matches the case of the `.pkl` file in the repo.

## 🗺️ Roadmap / Ideas

- [ ] Separate frontend and backend into distinct deployable services
- [ ] Add model explainability (e.g. SHAP values) to show which habits most influenced a score
- [ ] Add authentication + history if turned into a multi-user tool
- [ ] Expand dataset/model to reduce bias across countries and demographics
